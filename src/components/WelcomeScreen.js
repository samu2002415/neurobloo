            <h3>Dysgraphia</h3>
            <p>Like dyslexia, dysgraphia is a learning disability that impacts a variety of potential difficulties with writing, including spelling, grammar and punctuation.‚ÄúSymptoms of dysgraphia include difficulties with visual motor skills (eye-hand coordination) necessary for writing, difficulty recalling how to spell sight words and difficulty accurately sounding out and spelling unfamiliar words,‚Äù</p>

            <h3>Dyscalculia</h3>
            <p>Dyscalculia is a learning disability related to math skills.‚ÄúMuch like dyslexia and dysgraphia, dyscalculia describes an impairment in aspects of the brain-based processes necessary for math,‚ÄùChildren with dyscalculia may struggle with number sense, which involves understanding quantities and numerical relationships. They might struggle with basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
Concepts like time, money and measurement can also pose challenges for individuals with dyscalculia. </p>

            <h3>Dyslexia</h3>
            <p>Dyslexia is the most common learning disability.Children with dyslexia often struggle with decoding words, recognizing letters and their sounds and comprehending written text. They may experience difficulties with spelling and writing skills and exhibit slower reading speeds compared to their peers. 
‚ÄúAlthough dyslexia is unrelated to mathematical processes, like addition and subtraction, it can also negatively impact a child‚Äôs ability to read, understand and complete word problems</p>
